      "question": "What does that mean?",
      "answer": "You're referring to the question about your age in the pre-anesthesia questionnaire (question q2). It just means we need to know how old you are for some medical calculations and safety reasons related to anesthesia. It's a routine question, and it helps us ensure everything goes smoothly with your procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why?",
      "answer": "The reason we ask about allergies is that certain types of anesthesia or medications can interact with substances you're allergic to, which could cause an adverse reaction. We want to make sure the team knows if there's anything that might affect how safely we can use medication for your procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is anesthesia?",
      "answer": "Anesthesia is a type of medicine that helps people feel no pain or very little pain during medical procedures, like surgeries. It also helps you relax and not remember everything about the procedure afterwards. The goal is to make sure you're comfortable throughout the process."
