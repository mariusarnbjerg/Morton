      "The sky appears blue to us during the day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are light waves?**\n",
      "Light is made up of tiny particles called photons, which travel in all directions from the sun. These photons have different wavelengths (colors), and when they hit our atmosphere, they interact with the molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rayleigh scattering:**\n",
      "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these gas molecules. The shorter wavelength (blue) light is scattered more than the longer wavelength (red) light because it has a higher frequency and is more easily deflected by the small molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like this: Imagine you're throwing a ball at a group of people. The smaller balls (blue light) bounce off in all directions, while the larger balls (red light) keep going straight.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why blue and not another color?**\n",
      "Now, why do we see mostly blue and not another color when we look up at the sky? There are a few reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wavelength:** As I mentioned earlier, shorter wavelengths like blue are scattered more than longer wavelengths like red.\n",
      "2. **Earth's atmosphere:** The amount of scattering also depends on the number of gas molecules in our atmosphere, which is higher near the surface.\n",
      "3. **Sun's light:** When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it has a wide range of colors, but most of them are absorbed by our atmosphere before reaching us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What about during sunrise and sunset?**\n",
      "During these times, the sky often appears more red or orange because:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Longer wavelengths dominate:** As the sun is lower in the sky, its light travels through more of our atmosphere to reach us. This means that longer wavelengths like red and orange are able to pass through with less scattering.\n",
      "2. **Dust and water vapor:** The presence of dust particles and water vapor in the air scatters shorter wavelengths (like blue) even more, allowing longer wavelengths to dominate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which favors shorter wavelengths like blue light. Our atmosphere plays a crucial role in this phenomenon, and the colors we see during different times of day are influenced by various factors like scattering, absorption, and the presence of particles in our air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that helps you understand why the sky is blue!\n",

      "1. **Heavy rain or mist:** When the atmosphere is filled with water droplets, they can scatter light in a way that favors green wavelengths.\n",
